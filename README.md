I have started a new repository, because I messed up submodules.


I am creating this project for school right now. The goal is to create an simple programming language, which is compiled to a intermediate format.
So far I have a working preprocessor and tokenizer. This project is still just a prototype, I am most likely going to rewrite large parts of it.

Don't forget to compile with release mode! I am working on separating the vm, so that only that part needs to be build in release.
